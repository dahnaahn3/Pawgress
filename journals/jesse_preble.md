Finally starting to code, creating journals, beginning work on database.

Authentication is up and running. Today we worked on combining the customer and trainer tables direclty into one user table. We also added a role to the user table. Some other small changes were made to the docker-compose.yaml to fix the api container crashing from the database not being up yet.
We decided on how to set up our roles and creating trainer roles.
