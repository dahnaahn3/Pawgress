Today, I worked on:

*Setting up Database Tables, getting Docker running, and connecting Beekeeper Studio

Jesse, Jennifer, Dahna and I worked together on finalizing our database tables and what datatypes we were going to need in the migrations folder for when we startup the application for backend.

I was reminded today that extra "," break code as usual, and also to include a WAIT_HOST in the yml file is necessary precaution otherwise the container's will throw errors when starting for first time.
