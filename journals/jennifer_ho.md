[Today, I worked on:

- Worked on refining API Endpoints &

Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
Petra who was working on the GHI with Azami.

Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
using this a lot!]
