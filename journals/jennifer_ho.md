[Today, I worked on:

- Jesse and I worked through how to creating the front-
  end auth

We spent the whole day troubleshooting what could be wrong
with the front-end that prevented the sign in functionality
from working - we saw a multitude of errors from CORS to
TypeErrors to Validation Errors... it ended up being a
backend issue. Lesson to learn - if you have a validation
error, it's likely related to the routers and the strict
validation of pydantic models! Also, be aware that not all
errors show you the source of the problem - be smart

[Today, I worked on:

- We started individual work today. I worked on
  completing the user endpoints, which required the
  creation of new Pydantic models for inputs and
  outputs. I additionally had to think through
  independent password update endpoint

- With Jesse, we worked through how to create the
  many-to-many relationship between pets &
  reservations with a junction table

I had an issue with the interactive fastAPI interface
not updating the API urls accordingly. The solution
ended up being a hard refresh - always a good way to
try to solve any problems that don't make sense!
