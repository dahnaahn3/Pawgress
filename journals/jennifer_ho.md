[Today, I worked on:

- We started individual work today. I worked on
  completing the user endpoints, which required the
  creation of new Pydantic models for inputs and
  outputs. I additionally had to think through

- With Jesse, we worked through how to create the
  many-to-many relationship between pets &
  reservations with a junction table

I had an issue with the interactive fastAPI interface
not updating the API urls accordingly. The solution
ended up being a hard refresh - always a good way to
try to solve any problems that don't make sense!

[Today, I worked on:

- Worked on refining API Endpoints &

Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
Petra who was working on the GHI with Azami.

Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
using this a lot!]
